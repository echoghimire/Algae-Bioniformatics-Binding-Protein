# PROTEIN OPTIMIZATION VISUALIZATION GUIDE

## Evolution Progress Plots

### What it shows:
- Fitness Components: CO2 affinity, stability, expression, catalytic efficiency
- Total Fitness: Combined optimization objective
- Population Diversity: Genetic diversity maintenance
- Improvement Rate: Generation-to-generation progress
- Correlation Matrix: Relationships between fitness components

### How to interpret:
- Upward trends indicate successful optimization
- Convergence shows algorithm stability
- High diversity prevents premature convergence
- Strong correlations reveal fitness trade-offs

## 3D Fitness Landscape

### What it shows:
- Evolution Trajectory: Path through fitness space
- Fitness Surface: Optimization landscape topology
- Pareto Front: Non-dominated solutions
- 4D Visualization: Multiple objectives simultaneously

### How to interpret:
- Smooth trajectories indicate efficient optimization
- Clustered endpoints show convergence
- Surface peaks represent optimal regions
- Color gradients show fitness variations

## Sequence Analysis

### What it shows:
- Amino Acid Composition: Frequency of each residue type
- Sequence Visualization: Color-coded functional regions
- Physicochemical Properties: Hydrophobicity, charge, size
- Position-wise Properties: Residue-specific characteristics

### How to interpret:
- Red regions = Zinc-binding residues (H)
- Blue regions = Catalytic residues (D, E)
- Gold regions = Structural residues (C)
- Green regions = Substrate-binding residues

## CO2 Binding Analysis

### What it shows:
- Overall Affinity: Combined CO2 binding score
- Zinc Binding: Capacity for zinc coordination
- Catalytic Score: Enzymatic activity potential
- Motif Analysis: Presence of known binding patterns

### How to interpret:
- Higher scores = Better CO2 processing ability
- Multiple histidines = Enhanced zinc binding
- D/E residues = Improved catalytic activity
- Conserved motifs = Validated binding patterns

## Key Metrics to Monitor

### Optimization Success Indicators:
1. Steady fitness improvement over generations
2. Maintained population diversity (>0.3)
3. Convergence within 80% of total generations
4. Balanced objective scores (no single objective dominance)

### Sequence Quality Indicators:
1. CO2 affinity >0.7 (excellent), >0.5 (good)
2. Zinc binding >0.8 (strong coordination)
3. Catalytic score >0.6 (active enzyme)
4. Key residue presence (H for zinc, D/E for catalysis)
