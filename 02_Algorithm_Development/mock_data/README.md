# Phase 2 - Mock Data

This directory contains early-stage algorithm prototypes with simulated data components.

## Contents

- `algae_protein_optimizer.py` - Basic protein optimization with simplified mock data
  - Early prototype of the genetic algorithm
  - Uses simplified fitness functions for testing
  - Demonstrates core optimization concepts

## Purpose

These early prototypes were used to:
- Validate the basic genetic algorithm approach
- Test system architecture before implementing real biochemical analysis
- Provide a baseline for comparing enhanced algorithms

## Evolution

Phase 2 evolved to include real scientific analysis in:
- `co2_binding_analyzer.py` - Real biochemical CO2 binding analysis
- `enhanced_ga_protein_optimizer.py` - Advanced genetic algorithm with real fitness evaluation

## Note

The main Phase 2 algorithms now use genuine biochemical calculations, while these mock versions remain for educational comparison.
