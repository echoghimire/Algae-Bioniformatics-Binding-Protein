# Phase 5 - Mock Data

This directory contains 3D molecular visualization prototypes with simulated structural data.

## Contents

- `enhanced_3d_dashboard.py` - Advanced 3D visualization dashboard with mock molecular structures
- `dashboard/` - Web-based 3D visualization interface with synthetic coordinate data
  - HTML templates for 3D molecular display
  - JavaScript components for interactive molecule manipulation
  - CSS styling for 3D visualization interfaces

## Purpose

These 3D visualization prototypes were used to:
- Develop interactive 3D molecular display capabilities
- Test protein structure visualization without computational chemistry overhead
- Design user interfaces for molecular manipulation and analysis
- Demonstrate 3D visualization concepts with placeholder structures

## Evolution

Phase 5 now includes real scientific 3D visualization in:
- `scientific_3d_viewer.py` - Interactive 3D viewer with genuine structure prediction
- `scientific_structure_predictor.py` - Chou-Fasman secondary structure prediction
- `protein_3d_generator.py` - Real coordinate generation from protein sequences

## Note

The main Phase 5 systems now provide authentic 3D molecular visualization using real structure prediction algorithms and physics-based coordinate generation, while these mock versions remain for interface development and educational purposes.
