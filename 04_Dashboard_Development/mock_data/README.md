# Phase 4 - Mock Data

This directory contains dashboard prototypes with simulated data for demonstration purposes.

## Contents

- `demo_dashboard.py` - Basic dashboard demonstration with mock optimization data
- `simple_dashboard.py` - Simplified dashboard interface with synthetic results
- `simple_demo.py` - Minimal demonstration of dashboard concepts
- `enhanced_demo_with_visualization.py` - Advanced demo combining dashboards and visualizations
- `main_optimization_demo.py` - Comprehensive demonstration of the complete optimization pipeline

## Purpose

These dashboard prototypes were used to:
- Design and test web interface layouts  
- Demonstrate real-time optimization tracking capabilities
- Validate user interaction patterns with synthetic data
- Showcase system integration without computational overhead

## Evolution

Phase 4 now includes real scientific dashboards in:
- `scientific_dashboard.py` - Real-time dashboard with genuine biochemical calculations
- `dashboard_server.py` - Production server with authentic optimization tracking

## Note

The main Phase 4 dashboards now provide real-time monitoring of actual protein optimization using genuine thermodynamic calculations, while these mock versions remain for interface testing and educational purposes.
