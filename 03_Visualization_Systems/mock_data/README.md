# Phase 3 - Mock Data

This directory contains visualization prototypes with simulated data components.

## Contents

- `advanced_visualizer.py` - Advanced visualization system with mock evolution curves
  - Random data generation for demonstration purposes
  - Showcases visualization capabilities without real calculations
  
- `visualization_showcase.py` - Comprehensive visualization demonstrations
  - Mock protein sequences and fitness scores
  - Simulated optimization trajectories for display testing

## Purpose

These visualization prototypes were used to:
- Develop and test visualization interfaces
- Demonstrate system capabilities to stakeholders
- Validate user experience design before implementing real calculations

## Evolution

Phase 3 now includes real scientific visualization in:
- `scientific_visualizer.py` - Real genetic algorithm visualization with biochemical fitness
- `scientific_co2_analyzer.py` - Genuine CO2 binding analysis integration

## Note

The main Phase 3 visualizations now use authentic biochemical data from Phase 2's CO2 binding analyzer, while these mock versions remain for comparison and educational purposes.
