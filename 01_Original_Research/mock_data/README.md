# Phase 1 - Mock Data

This directory contains simulated data generation scripts for educational and testing purposes.

## Contents

- `runfile.py` - Google Colab script that generates 100 simulated protein optimization trials
  - Creates synthetic protein sequences
  - Generates mock fitness scores and binding affinity data
  - Produces formatted trial results for downstream analysis

## Purpose

These mock data generators were used to:
- Test the analysis pipeline with consistent, reproducible data
- Demonstrate the system capabilities before real experiments
- Provide educational examples of the expected data format

## Note

For actual research, replace these mock data generators with real experimental protocols and genuine protein optimization trials.
