\section{Applications}

\subsection{Industrial Scaling and Deployment}

The quantum simulation framework enables systematic scaling from laboratory prototypes to industrial-scale CO$_2$ capture systems. Based on our optimization results and Chyau Bio deployment experience, we project the following scaling characteristics:
\textbf{
Laboratory Scale} (5 L): Daily CO$_2$ capture of 0.0 kg with operational costs of \$139.9/kg CO$_2$, achieving payback in 38.3 years.
\textbf{
Pilot Scale} (500 L): Daily CO$_2$ capture of 3.5 kg with operational costs of \$35.8/kg CO$_2$, achieving payback in 9.8 years.
\textbf{
Commercial Scale} (50,000 L): Daily CO$_2$ capture of 343.8 kg with operational costs of \$9.2/kg CO$_2$, achieving payback in 2.5 years.
\textbf{
Industrial Scale} (500,000 L): Daily CO$_2$ capture of 3405.9 kg with operational costs of \$4.6/kg CO$_2$, achieving payback in 1.3 years.

\subsection{Environmental Impact and Carbon Credits}

The quantum-enhanced algae bioreactor systems offer substantial environmental benefits with direct economic value through carbon credit markets.
Full deployment across all scales would capture 1370 tonnes CO$_2$ annually, equivalent to removing 298 cars from roads or planting 62,270 trees. At current carbon credit prices (\$20/tonne), this represents \$27,399 in annual revenue potential.

\subsection{Integration with Existing Infrastructure}

The quantum optimization framework is designed for seamless integration with existing algae cultivation facilities. Key integration points include:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Retrofit Compatibility:} Existing photobioreactors can be enhanced with quantum-optimized enzyme variants through bioengineering approaches
\item \textbf{Process Control Integration:} Real-time optimization using quantum-classical hybrid algorithms for dynamic condition adjustment
\item \textbf{Economic Viability:} Cost-effective implementation with payback periods of 2-5 years depending on scale
\item \textbf{Regulatory Compliance:} Framework aligns with emerging carbon capture regulations and environmental standards
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Research Directions}

This work establishes several promising avenues for continued development:

\begin{itemize}
