# Phase 6 - Mock Data

This directory contains quantum calculation simulations and demo interfaces for educational purposes.

## Contents

- `simple_quantum_launcher.py` - Educational quantum calculation simulator
  - Mock molecular orbital energies for demonstration
  - Simulated quantum chemistry results for learning purposes
  - Educational explanations of quantum concepts

- `quantum_dashboard_data/` - Pre-generated mock quantum calculation results
  - Synthetic molecular orbital data
  - Mock energy level calculations
  - Simulated quantum chemistry outputs

- `quantum_visualizations/` - Visualization assets for quantum demonstrations
  - Mock molecular orbital plots
  - Simulated energy level diagrams
  - Educational quantum visualization components

- `simple_quantum_dashboard.html` - Web interface for quantum simulation display
- `test_buttons.html` - Interface testing components

## Purpose

These quantum simulation tools were used to:
- Provide educational demonstrations of quantum chemistry concepts
- Test quantum calculation interfaces without computational chemistry software
- Demonstrate potential quantum-enhanced optimization capabilities
- Showcase integration possibilities with quantum computing frameworks

## Real vs Mock Quantum

**Mock Data (This Directory):**
- Simulated quantum results for educational purposes
- Consistent demo values regardless of input
- Fast execution for interface testing

**Real Quantum (Main Directory):**
- `real_quantum_launcher.py` - Attempts genuine quantum calculations when libraries available
- Uses RDKit for real molecular property calculations when possible
- Falls back to educational simulations when quantum libraries unavailable

## Note

For genuine quantum chemistry calculations, specialized software like Gaussian, ORCA, or quantum computing frameworks would be required. These mock versions provide educational value and interface testing capabilities.
